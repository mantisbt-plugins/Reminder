This plugin can be used to send periodic email reminders to bug reporters,
managers, and assignees.

The files in the `plugins/Reminder/scripts` directory should be run directly,
from the command line.

1. `bug_feedback_mail.php` sends emails to reporters listing all bugs awaiting
   their feedback.
2. `bug_reminder_mail.php` sends emails to assignees when bugs are approaching
   their due date.
3. `assigned_bugs.php` sends emails to assignees listing all open bugs that are
   assigned to them.

This plugin is build upon version 1.2.x of mantis and should be installed as
any other plugin. No Mantis scripts or tables are being altered.

* Automatically generating mail                                                *
********************************************************************************

After this, bug_reminder_mail can be used via cron like this:
*/1440 *   *   *   * lynx --dump http://mantis.homepage.com/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php

or via command line interface
*/1440 *   *   *   * /usr/local/bin/php /path/to/mantis/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php

This line would send out a reminder every day.

You also can use a scheduled task under windows by calling a batch-file like:

REM *** this batch is running as a scheduled task under the ... Account ***
g:
cd \inetpub\wwwroot\mantis
php.exe plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php


One can also schedule a job to prompt reporters to respond because their
issue has status Feedback. In that case replace bug_reminder_mail.php with
bug_feedback_mail.php

On top of that, I have created a little variant which will create a
spreadsheet with issues getting due. Call script like:

http://www.YourMantisHome.com/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_due_overview2.php?days=2&status=50

If you do not apply parameters, the script will default to the above.

In the script directory you will also find a script called
bug_reminder_mail_test.php This script which you should call from within the
browser (once logged on) will provide useful feedback if things are not
working as expected. In case of a blank screen, all is processed normally.

For option Days/Hours, the script will fetch the plugin definition.
