This plugin can be used to send periodic email reminders to bug reporters,
managers, and assignees.

The files in the `plugins/Reminder/scripts` directory should be run directly,
from the command line.

1. `bug_feedback_mail.php` sends emails to reporters listing all bugs awaiting
   their feedback.
2. `bug_reminder_mail.php` sends emails to assignees when bugs are approaching
   their due date.
3. `bug_reminder_unique_mail.php` do the same as script nÂ°2 but only when the
   due date is the exact planned day (see parameter reminder_days_treshold)
4. `assigned_bugs.php` sends emails to assignees listing all open bugs that are
   assigned to them.

This plugin is build upon version 1.2.x of mantis and should be installed like
any other plugin. No Mantis scripts or tables are being create/altered.

* Automatically generating mail                                                *
********************************************************************************

The bug_reminder_mail script can be called via cron like this (using Lynx):
*/1440 *   *   *   * lynx --dump http://mantis.homepage.com/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php

or via command line interface (recommanded):
*/1440 *   *   *   * /usr/local/bin/php /path/to/mantis/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php

This line would send out a reminder every day until the due date.

You can also decide to run the script every day at 7a.m. and send a reminder only
if it's near the due date (see parameter reminder_days_treshold for nb of days/hours):
0 7 * * * /usr/local/bin/php /path/to/mantis/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_unique_mail.php

You also can use a scheduled task under windows by calling a batch-file like:

REM *** this batch is running as a scheduled task under the ... Account ***
g:
cd \inetpub\wwwroot\mantis
php.exe plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php

One can also schedule a job to prompt reporters to respond because their
issue has status Feedback. In that case replace bug_reminder_mail.php with
bug_feedback_mail.php

********************************************************************************

On top of that, I have created a little variant which will create a
spreadsheet with issues getting due. Call script like:

http://www.YourMantisHome.com/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_due_overview2.php?days=2&status=50

If you do not apply parameters, the script will default to the above.

In the script directory you will also find a script called
bug_reminder_mail_test.php. This script which you should call from within the
browser (once logged on) will provide useful feedback if things are not
working as expected. In case of a blank screen, all is processed normally.

You can also use the test script named bug_reminder_unique_mail_test.php to test
the unique reminder feature.

For option Days/Hours, the script will fetch the plugin definition.
