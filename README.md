# Reminder Plugin

Copyright (c) 2009 - 2024 Cas Nuy - cas@nuy.info - http://www.nuy.info

Released under the [GPL 2.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0)

## Description

This plugin can be used to send  periodic email reminders to bug reporters,
managers, and assignees.

The files in the `plugins/Reminder/scripts` directory should be run directly,
from the command line.

1. `bug_feedback_mail.php` sends emails to reporters listing all bugs awaiting
   their feedback.
2. `bug_reminder_mail.php` sends emails to assignees when bugs are approaching
   their due date.
3. `assigned_bugs.php` sends emails to assignees listing all open bugs that are
   assigned to them.


## Requirements

The plugin requires MantisBT version 2.0 or higher.

Make sure to have this statement in confg_inc.php:
```
$g_path = 'http://path-to-your-mantis-installation/';
```


## Installation

Like any other plugin. After copying to your webserver :

- Start mantis as administrator
- Select manage
- Select manage Plugins
- Select Install behind *Reminder*
- Once installed, click on the plugin's name for further configuration.

No Mantis scripts or tables are being altered.


## Configuration options

```
// What is the body of the E-mail
reminder_mail_subject	= "Following issue will be Due shortly";

// What is the subject of the grouped E-mail
reminder_group_subject	= "You have issues approaching their Due Date";

// What is the start of the body of the grouped E-mail
reminder_groupbody1	= "Please review the following issues";

// What is the end of the body of the grouped E-mail
reminder_groupbody2	= "Please do not reply to this message";

// perform for which project
reminder_project_id = 0; means ALL

// how many days before Due date should we take into account
reminder_days_treshold  = 2;

// Should we use hours instead of days
reminder_hours		  	= OFF;

// Should we store this reminder as bugnote
reminder_store_as_note = OFF;
// only possible for handler

// For which status to send reminders
reminder_bug_status = ASSIGNED

// Ignore reminders for issues with no Due date set
reminder_ignore_unset = ON

// Ignore reminders for issues with Due dates in the past
reminder_ign_past = ON

// only valid for the mail function, downloads will always have duedates that have gone by

// Create overview per handler
reminder_handler = ON

// Group issues by Handler
reminder_group_issues = ON

// Group issues by project/handler
reminder_group_project = OFF

// Create overview per manager/project
reminder_manager_overview = ON
//
// access level for manager= 70
// this needs to be made flexible
// we will only produce overview for those projects that have a separate manager
//

// Select project to receive Feedback mail
reminder_feedback_project = 0; means ALL

// For which status to send feedbackreminders
reminder_bug_status = FEEDBACK

// On which account should we run the background jobs
// In principle I would advise to use an account with enough rights,
// so I suggest something like the admin account (mantis account).
reminder_login = 'admin'
```

## Automatically generating mail

Once configuration is complete, `bug_reminder_mail.php` script can be used
as described below, depending on your operating system.


### Linux

Use a cron job like this:
```
*/1440 *   *   *   * lynx --dump http://mantis.homepage.com/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php
```

or via PHP command line interface
```
*/1440 *   *   *   * /usr/local/bin/php /path/to/mantis/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php
```

This would send out a reminder every day.


### Windows

You can use a scheduled task under Windows by calling a batch-file like:

```
REM *** this batch is running as a scheduled task under the ... Account ***
g:
cd \inetpub\wwwroot\mantis
php.exe plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_reminder_mail.php
```

### Reminders for feedback status

One can also schedule a job to prompt reporters to respond because their
issue has status *Feedback*. In that case use the same methods as described
above, but replace `bug_reminder_mail.php` with `bug_feedback_mail.php`.


## Extras

On top of that, I have created a little variant which will create a
spreadsheet with issues getting due. Call script like:

```
http://www.YourMantisHome.com/plugins/Reminder/scripts/bug_due_overview2.php?days=2&status=50
```

If you do not apply parameters, the script will default to the above.

In the script directory you will also find a script called
`bug_reminder_mail_test.php`, which you should call from within the
browser (once logged on) to provide useful feedback if things are not
working as expected. In case of a blank screen, all is processed normally.

For option Days/Hours, the script will fetch the plugin definition.
